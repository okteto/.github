# Develop and preview at the speed of the cloud with Okteto

## Learn 

Our remote development environments, powered by Kubernetes, give you a cloud-native developer experience that makes it easy to develop apps with multiple microservices, without needing to become an expert on the cloud provider or infrastructure. 

See changes in seconds, using a realistic replica of your production environment. Okteto will replace just the portion of code you’re working on in development to your environment so you can see your changes as they’d appear in production. 

Get instant feedback from your entire team with ephemeral environments. Code faster, without burning your laptop!
